Several solutions exist to address this issue:

1. **Remove `!important`:** If possible, remove the `!important` declaration from `.child`.  This is often the best approach as `!important` should be avoided for maintainability.

2. **Increase Specificity (Less Recommended):** Alternatively, if removing `!important` is not possible, you can increase the specificity of the `.child` selector.  This might involve adding more parent selectors or using more specific attribute selectors.  This is generally less preferred as it can lead to less maintainable code.

3. **Refactor CSS:** The best solution is often to refactor your CSS structure to avoid these conflicting declarations.   This can involve restructuring your classes or selectors to avoid such a specific conflict.

The following shows a refactored solution (bugSolution.css) by removing `!important`:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```
